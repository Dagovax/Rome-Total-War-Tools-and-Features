# Rome:Total War -- Tools and Features
A repository containing scripts that Dagovax created to make modding Rome: Total War easier

# 3ds Max
Currently, two new scripts are added to this repository:

## Installation
Installation of 3ds Max scripts is quite easy:
```
Place the .ms script inside your 'Autodesk\3ds Max [version]\scripts' folder.
To make them start up together with 3ds Max, place them in the 'Startup' folder.
You can find the scripts under the Utility tab. 
```

## RTW Building Export
This [script](https://github.com/Dagovax/Rome-Total-War-Tools-and-Features/tree/master/3dsMax%20Scripts/RTW%20Building%20Export) let you export building coordinates to be used in settlement plans.

### Usage
```
1. Select any object and/or groups
2. Click the 'Export Selected Building(s)' button
3. Follow the instructions.
4. Just copy/paste the result into your settlement plan to get it working.
```
<B>HINT</B>: Name the buildings/groups like they should be regarding their name in DBB. You then don't need to change the names of the output afterwards!

## RTW Skeleton Position Export
This [script](https://github.com/Dagovax/Rome-Total-War-Tools-and-Features/tree/master/3dsMax%20Scripts/RTW%20Skeleton%20Position%20Export) let you export bone coordinates of new skeletons in the right format for skeleton text files!.

### Usage
```
1. Position the bones using the move tool, don't use the rotate function because that won't work.
2. Click the 'Export Bone Coordinates' button
3. Select the skeleton you used, in order to get the best result
4. Copy/paste the result coordinates into your skeleton file where you need to set the bone position.
```
<B>NOTE:</B> A skeleton file is very advanced extracted stuff, so don't mess with removing zero's or other important stuff. Only change the same section!
